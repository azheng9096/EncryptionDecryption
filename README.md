# EncryptionDecryption

## Encryption Algorithm:
1. Reverse string
2. Combine every 2 characters of the message 
3. Reverse alphabet
4. Turn all characters into ascii
5. Add random number (0-5) to ascii (Caesar Cipher) and concatenate it after the ascii of character
6. Turn all value of ascii into hex (except the random number)
  - If the hex is a letter convert into its ascii
7. Convert into binary
